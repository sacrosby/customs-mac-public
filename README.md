This installs the cusomizations I prefer to use on MacOS, this is the public edition.

# My Priority Tool List
- Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
  > This makes installation of most packages very easy. Everything here is installed with homebrew. I'm considering moving to Nix (https://nixos.org/download/)
- htop (https://htop.dev/)
  > A prefered way to monitor my local machine.
- oh-my-posh (https://ohmyposh.dev/)
- zsh-syntax-highlighting
  > Both these are for customizations of the Shell *(will make some of my customizations public soon)* 
- Mos (https://mos.caldis.me/)
  > Corrects the scroll wheel direction issue on a physical mouse. It preserves natural touchpad directions.
- Ghostty
  > The best terminal, hands down. MacOS native terminal is not even close.
- Alfred / Raycast (https://www.alfredapp.com/ & https://www.raycast.com/)
  > Application Launcher and multitool -- I have used Alfred for years, evaluating Raycast. I use this several dozen if not hundred+ times a day.
  > I change my keyboard shortcut to OPT+SPACE (preserves CMD+SPACE for Spotlight, which I rarely use)
- SublimeText (https://www.sublimetext.com/)
  > The best text editor.

# Other tools (just par for the course):
- git
- powershell
- google-chrome
- visual-studio-code
- ollama (if you're into that)
